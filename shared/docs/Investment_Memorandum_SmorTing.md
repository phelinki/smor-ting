Confidential Investment Opportunity: Liberian Professional Marketplace dba SmorTing

This memorandum is confidential. Do not distribute without permission.

Executive Summary

SmorTing is a mobile‑first professional services marketplace for Liberia. We connect customers to vetted local providers (agents) across home services, beauty, events, repairs, logistics, and micro‑trades. The platform is offline‑first, secure by design, and built around mobile‑money. Our purpose is to formalize the informal services economy by improving discovery, trust, and payments — raising provider incomes and giving consumers reliable, safe experiences.

Why we will win
- Built-for-Liberia product: offline‑first sync for poor connectivity; low‑bandwidth UI; USSD/SMS fallbacks; mobile‑money native.
- Trust engine: KYC’d providers, tiered verification, ratings, dispute resolution, service guarantee, fraud/risk controls.
- Supply enablement: onboarding playbooks via community orgs; lightweight provider tools (in‑app scheduling, quotes, wallet); skills micro‑credentialing with NGOs/TVETs; micro‑insurance options.
- Payments advantage: mobile‑money integration with multi‑rail fallback; escrow‑like flows; risk reserving; instant payouts.
- Default‑alive plan: 36‑month roadmap that becomes contribution‑margin positive early, then funds growth from operations.

Ask
- $50,000 pre‑seed to fully execute the 36‑month plan with disciplined burn and revenue-first milestones.

The Deal

Amount requested: $50,000

Option 1 (Debt)
- We repay $125,000 over 3 years (5% annual interest) starting Month 24.
- Schedule: equal monthly payments Months 24–59 (~$3,472/month). Prepayment allowed without penalty.
- Collateral: none; negative pledge on IP; quarterly financial and KPI reporting; information rights.

Option 2 (Equity)
- $50,000 for 5% equity ($1.0M post‑money).
- If we sell for $5M, you receive ~$250k.
- Rationale: strong product readiness (backend + mobile apps), mobile‑money path, Liberia whitespace in vertical services, high‑trust UX.

Option 3 (Revenue Share)
- 5% of gross revenue until repaid 2x ($100,000).
- Expected payback: 18–30 months from launch (base‑case).

Exit Paths
- Dividends from operating cash by 2027+; or strategic acquisition by regional marketplace/fintech expanding services.

Where the Money Goes (Use of Funds)

- Product/Engineering (40%) — offline sync, USSD/SMS bridge, provider tools, fraud/risk, analytics.
- Market Activation (30%) — provider ambassador program, community partnerships, referral incentives, category seeding.
- Operations & Compliance (20%) — KYC/AML, legal, data protection, support playbooks.
- Contingency (10%) — buffer for payment rail delays, infra spikes.

Financial Projections (36 months)

Assumptions
- Take rate: 12–15% of GMV (category dependent).
- AOV: $12–$25 early categories; rising toward $30–$50 with skilled trades.
- Provider ramp: 60 active (M1–3) → ~800 active (M25–36); focus Monrovia first, then greater Montserrado.
- Expense discipline: lean team, community-led onboarding, cloud credits, automation.

12‑month view (high‑level, USD/month)
- M1–3: Rev $0–$1.5k; Exp $8.5k–$10k; Net −$8.5k to −$8k
- M4–6: Rev $3k–$6k; Exp ~$10k; Net −$7k to −$4k
- M7–9: Rev $8k–$12k; Exp $11k–$12k; Net −$3k to $1k
- M10–12: Rev $14k–$18k; Exp $12k–$13k; Net $1k–$6k

Months 13–24
- Rev $18k → $30k; Exp $13k–$17k; Net $4k–$15k
- Breakeven expected Months 12–18 (category‑mix dependent).

Months 25–36
- Rev $30k → $45k; Exp $17k–$22k; Net $8k–$23k
- Allocate surpluses: (a) growth loop bounties; (b) risk reserve; (c) debt/revenue‑share service capacity.

Breakeven & Sensitivities
- Breakeven at ~200–250 monthly customers at ~$50/order (12–15% take) or ~1,000 orders at $12–$15 AOV.
- Downside (50% lower sales): pause new categories; reduce paid marketing by 50%; extend runway 6–8 months; focus on top‑2 categories.

How You’ll Be Repaid

Debt
- Equal monthly payments starting Month 24 (~$3,472). We maintain a cash‑sweep policy on excess free cash.

Equity
- Likely outcomes: acquisition by regional marketplace or fintech, or dividend policy from durable cashflows.

Revenue Share
- 5% of topline until $100k returned. Priority waterfall ahead of dividends.

36‑Month Operating Plan (Phased)

Phase I — Default‑Alive Launch (Months 0–9)
- Goals: Launch 2–3 hero categories; reach first 500 monthly orders; NPS ≥ 40; fraud loss < 0.3% GMV.
- Build: offline sync v1; provider wallet; escrow‑like release; ratings; dispute flows; lightweight CRM.
- Distribution: community ambassadors; trade guilds; churches/mosques; radio + WhatsApp referral trees.
- Payment rails: integrate multiple mobile‑money providers; settlement reconciliation scripts; payout SLAs.

Phase II — Quality & Trust Flywheel (Months 9–18)
- Skills micro‑credentialing with TVET/NGOs; badge tiers unlock better placement.
- Buyer protection: limited service guarantee; dispute SLA; selective refunds from risk reserve.
- Dynamic matching: ETA windows, capacity indicators; price guidance per micro‑market.
- B2B beachhead: offices/SMEs for recurring facilities tasks; monthly invoices; lower CAC, higher retention.

Phase III — Scale & Financial Services Adjacent (Months 18–36)
- Expansion: additional categories with verified suppliers (electrical, plumbing, events, catering).
- Embedded finance (partner‑led): equipment micro‑leasing for top‑tier providers; order‑based working capital; insurance bundles.
- USSD/IVR concierge: booking flows for non‑smartphone users; agent‑assisted placing; improves SOM.
- Data products: anonymized demand heatmaps for partners (municipal, NGOs, MNOs) within privacy guardrails.

Go‑To‑Market and Moats (Deep Strategies)

1) Community‑anchored supply acquisition
- Partner with neighborhood associations, trade guilds, faith networks for batch onboarding, identity vouching, and first‑jobs seeding.
- Micro‑credentialing pathways with TVET/NGOs; verified badges increase ranking and fees.

2) Trust and protection as product
- Tiered verification, background checks (where lawful), minimum rating thresholds; transparent penalties; service guarantee.
- Dispute resolution with timeboxed SLAs; risk reserve funded from take‑rate basis points; fraud heuristics and blocklists.

3) Payments as retention and differentiation
- Instant payouts (less fees) for highly rated providers; weekly settlement otherwise; chargeback shield patterns.
- Multi‑rail mobile‑money integration; reconcile variance with automated scripts; notify payout exceptions proactively.

4) Offline‑first reliability
- Graceful offline flows, background sync, low‑data assets; USSD/IVR for non‑smartphone demand; SMS updates and OTPs.

5) Category discipline and density
- Win 1–2 categories to local density before expanding; enforce price guidance; maintain fulfillment SLAs; avoid thin markets.

6) B2B recurring revenue wedge
- Sell reliability to SMEs and compounds (cleaning, maintenance, security call‑outs); lower seasonality, better AR.

7) Diaspora and remittance‑linked demand (outside‑the‑box)
- “Book a service back home” for relatives; diaspora pays via card/remittance partner; local job fulfilled via SmorTing; battle‑tested escrow release.

8) Partner distribution
- MNO bundles (zero‑rating select APIs/SMS), handset channels, radio integrations, and NGO programs (jobs placement) to reduce CAC.

KPIs We Manage
- Supply: active providers, job acceptance rate, first‑job completion rate, repeat completion rate.
- Demand: MAUs, orders/month, conversion to order, reorder rate, NPS.
- Quality: dispute rate, refund rate, on‑time arrival %, average rating.
- Unit economics: CAC, blended take rate, contribution margin/order, payout delays, fraud loss % of GMV.

Risks & Mitigations
- Market adoption (two‑sided): subsidize initial jobs; referral bounties; ambassador pipeline; concentrate density.
- Payments/API instability: integrate multiple providers; pre‑fund buffer; clear comms; fallback to manual payout when necessary.
- Trust & safety: KYC/liveness checks; tiered verification; guarantee with caps; fraud analytics.
- Regulatory & data: legal review for KYC/AML; encrypt at rest/in transit; least‑privilege; audit logs.
- Infra/connectivity: offline‑first; SMS/USSD; progressive sync; local caching.

Investor Protections
- Debt: information rights; negative pledge; cash sweep on excess cash; cure periods.
- Revenue share: monthly topline reporting; first claim on 5% gross until 2x returned.
- Equity: MFN on friend‑and‑family notes; pro‑rata in next round.
