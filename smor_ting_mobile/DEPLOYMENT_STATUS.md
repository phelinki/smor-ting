## 🚨 **What Needs to Be Done:**

### **1. Configure Play Console Permissions** ⚠️
The service account needs permissions in Google Play Console:

**Current Issue:** Permission denied - service account needs "Release apps to testing tracks" permission

**Solution:**
1. Go to [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Sign in with `pkaleewoun@gmail.com`
3. Find your app "Smor-Ting"
4. Look for API access settings (try "Advanced settings" under "Test and release")
5. Grant the service account `play-store-deployer` the permission: **"Release apps to testing tracks"**

### **2. Create App in Play Console** (if not done)
If the app doesn't exist in Play Console:
1. Click "Create app"
2. Name: Smor-Ting
3. Package name: `com.smorting.app.smor_ting_mobile`
4. Type: App
5. Price: Free

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Step 1: Configure Permissions**
Follow the steps above to grant service account permissions in Play Console.

### **Step 2: Deploy to Internal Testing**
Once permissions are configured, run:
```bash
python3 scripts/play_store/deploy_aab.py
```

### **Step 3: Add Testers**
After successful deployment:
1. Go to Play Console → Testing → Internal testing
2. Click "Testers"
3. Add email addresses of testers
4. Share the testing link

## 📱 **Expected Result:**
- App will be available for internal testing
- Testers can download from Google Play Store
- Updates can be deployed automatically via CLI

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Permission Denied:**
- Check that the service account has the right permissions in Play Console
- Verify the package name matches exactly: `com.smorting.app.smor_ting_mobile`
- Ensure the app exists in Play Console

### **If App Not Found:**
- Create the app in Play Console first
- Use the exact package name: `com.smorting.app.smor_ting_mobile`
