# Google Play Store Upload Instructions

## Files Ready for Upload:
- **App Bundle (Recommended)**: \`build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab\`
- **APK (Backup)**: \`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk\`

## Next Steps:

1. **Go to Google Play Console**: https://play.google.com/console
2. **Sign in with**: pkaleewoun@gmail.com
3. **Create New App** (if not already created):
   - App name: Smor-Ting
   - Default language: English
   - App or game: App
   - Free or paid: Free
   - Category: Business

4. **Upload App Bundle**:
   - Go to Production track
   - Click "Create new release"
   - Upload the \`app-release.aab\` file
   - Add release notes
   - Save and review

5. **Complete Store Listing**:
   - App details
   - Graphics (icons, screenshots)
   - Content rating
   - Pricing & distribution

6. **Submit for Review**:
   - Review all information
   - Click "Start rollout to Production"

## Important Notes:
- Keep your keystore file safe (\`android/app/keystore/upload-keystore.jks\`)
- Store your keystore passwords securely
- The review process typically takes 1-3 days
- Monitor your email for any issues from Google

## Troubleshooting:
- If upload fails, check that your app meets Google Play policies
- Ensure all required permissions are properly declared
- Verify your app doesn't crash on startup
- Check that your app works offline (if claimed)
