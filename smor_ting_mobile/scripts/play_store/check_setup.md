## üîç **If "Setup" is Missing**

### **Possible Reasons:**
1. **App not fully created** - Complete app creation first
2. **Account not verified** - Wait for Google's verification
3. **Wrong section** - Make sure you're in the app, not the developer dashboard
4. **New interface** - Look for "Settings" or "Configuration" instead

### **Alternative Paths:**
- Try clicking on your **app name** at the top
- Look for **"Settings"** or **"Configuration"**
- Check if there's a **"More"** or **"..."** menu
- Search for **"API"** in the console search bar
